# Castle-Game
Data structure project

This project is mainly about creating a code of a game using C++ and to use the main priciples and concepts of data stuctures and how to use (Stacks, Queues, Priority_Queues....) the castle fight with the enemies(Fighters, Freezers, Healers) Fighters can only fight with the castle Freezers only are trying to freeze the castle Healers are trying to heal the fighters and freezers Healers could go backward and forward. Meanwhile, other enemies can not go backward. All enemies do its own missions in certain techniques Each enemy type can do certain identified tasks Froozen castle can not fight If healer is killed 3 meters apart from the castle, the castle increases its own health by 3% The castle could kill or freeze enemies for a time .If the enemy is killed, put that enemy in the killed quarter.
Castle, fighters, freezers, and healers have certain power, and health.

In specific moments, the castle could use its own supersoldiers we could run the program in silent, interactive, step by step, or demo modes

we can choose the file of the data of the whole enemies

Red rectangulars -> Fighters 
Yellow rectangulars -> Healers 
Blue rectangulars -> Freezers 
Green Rectangulars -> Super Soldiers (from the castle) 
The castle -> the middle of the screen

the distance of the enemy from the castle and health are driven from certain equations

Finally, there are a printed file of the whole battle, For example, Castle win or lose, which enemy die first, some statistics about the enemies
